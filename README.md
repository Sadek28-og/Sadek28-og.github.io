# Portfolio Starter

A clean, fast portfolio you can deploy to GitHub Pages in minutes.

## Quick start
1. Replace text like **Your Name**, update links in `index.html`.
2. Put your real portrait in `assets/portrait.png` (update file path).
3. Add your projects in `projects.js` (`PROJECTS` array).
4. (Optional) Replace `assets/Your_Name_CV.pdf`.
5. Deploy.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
- Create a repo named `yourusername.github.io`.
- Upload all files from this folder to the repo root.
- In *Settings â†’ Pages*, ensure the branch is set to deploy from `/ (root)`.
- Your site will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io`.

## Form handling
The contact form uses Formspree. Replace `{your_form_id}` in `index.html` with your Formspree form ID (or swap to another service).

## Custom domain
- Add your domain's DNS `A` records to GitHub's IPs and a `CNAME` file with your domain.
